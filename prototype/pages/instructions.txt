For the most part, you won't need to edit the files and folders under this section. You might want to delete or add some though.

Every file is exactly the same so they can be added and removed easily. The navMap is what gives meaning to these pages. There are some things to know about though.

If the navigation is ever not quite working as expected, check that the file that the link is trying to land on actually exists in this folder.

The auto-link generation looks at what files exist in this section and then generates a link based on what it finds.


--- Rules that the Auto Link generation code follows ---

If the file it is looking for exists, it links to that.

If the target file doesn't exist but it has a child page that exists, it will link to the first child page instead (good for situations when you have a link for a group of pages but you do not have a landing page template to go to).

If the target file doesn't exist and it doesn't have a child page, it will link to the first sibling page instead. (this is good for listing pages where all the links go to pages with the same template)

If the target file, doesn't exist and the target doesn't have any children or siblings, The link will put "#" in as the href.

If none of those are what you are after or the link generation is buggin out in some way, you can easily overide the link for a specific item in the navMap with whatever you want by doing this:

[
  'title' => 'Page title',
  'link' => 'http://www.google.com'
]

Again, check that the file you want exists first before overiding with something like '/pages/1/3/4'. Hardcoding the links deminishes site maintainability.
