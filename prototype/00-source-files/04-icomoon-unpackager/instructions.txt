Drop all the contents of an icomoon package into this folder and it will automatically copy the font files to the correct locations for you

(Doesn't actually work yet)


The plan:

- copy fonts to fonts folder
- copy css to config folder but rename it to an scss file in the process
- after copying use grunt string find/replace to remove the @font-face stuff at top of file and replace with the top bit of the sass syntax
- use grunt regex find/replace to convert the css into the sass map format
- use grunt banner (https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-banner) to add the closing brackets of the sass syntax at the bottom of the file
