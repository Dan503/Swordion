Do not edit images in the "auto-sprite" folder. They are images generated through Grunt.

The "content" folder is for images that would be handled through a content management system when the site goes into build phase.

The "design" folder is for any images that are integral to the design of the project that aren't generated through the auto-sprite functionality.
