    <h3>Significant activities and achievements in 2014&ndash;15</h3>
    <?php heading(1) ?>
    <p>KPI achieved:</p>
    <p>High-quality, strategic and timely advice on necessary market settings to promote competition, while ensuring access to basic services, making available socially valuable content, and safeguarding consumers from inappropriate content.</p>
    <p>Australia Post reports independently of the Department. The Minister is a joint Shareholder Minister responsible for the oversight of Australia Post along with the Minister for Finance. In 2014&ndash;15, we provided advice to the Minister on Australia Post&rsquo;s activities, operations, postal reform and future priorities.</p>
    <p>We continue to work with Australia Post to make sure it is able to provide a postal service that efficiently meets the changing expectations of the Australian community.</p>
    <h3>Postal reform</h3>
    <p>More and more Australians are opting to communicate via digital options such as email, social networking and SMS rather than letters. Businesses and governments are increasingly interacting with their customers this way as well. This represents a fundamental shift in community expectations about the value of letters and the postal service&rsquo;s role in facilitating social and commercial communications.</p>
    <p>As a result, Australia Post&rsquo;s domestic reserved letter volumes have declined by over one billion letters since they peaked in 2007&ndash;08. In 2014&ndash;15, the volume of ordinary mail declined by more than 10 per cent, placing Australia Post under significant financial pressure. Meanwhile substantial losses in its regulated mail business are threatening the overall financial viability of the corporation.</p>
    <p>To address this, on 3 March 2015 the Minister for Communications and the Minister for Finance jointly announced reforms to help Australia Post remain viable. The announcement included a short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVmZX1FebYU">YouTube clip</a> and a <a href="http://www.malcolmturnbull.com.au/media/reforming-australia-post">Tech Talk with the Managing Director from The Boston Consulting Group</a> on the need for reform. We supported the Minister in developing and announcing the reform initiatives, including working with Australia Post and other government agencies.</p>
    <p>The reforms involve regulatory changes to allow Australia Post to introduce a two-speed letter service comprising regular and priority services. Australia Post is expected to introduce the two-speed letter service in early 2016.</p>
    <p>Under the priority service, mail will be delivered to the existing letters delivery timeframes and regular mail will be delivered on average two days slower than the current timeframes. Both services will be delivered five days per week to 98 per cent of addresses. Regular mail will be regulated by a community service obligation, and will also be subject to pricing oversight by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.</p>
    <p>The reforms will not affect Australia Post&rsquo;s other regulatory obligations such as the number of postal outlets (including licensed post offices) or street posting boxes.</p>

    <h3>Senate Committee inquiry into Australia Post and licensed post offices</h3>
    <p>On 14 November 2013, the Senate referred the issue of Australia Post&rsquo;s performance in communities and its operations in relation to licensed post offices to the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee for inquiry and report. On 24 September 2014, the Committee released its final report.</p>
    <p>In response to the Committee&rsquo;s findings, Australia Post has announced a series of measures to enhance the sustainability of the post office network. We supported the Government to develop its response, which included consulting with Australia Post.</p>

    <p>KPIs achieved:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Promoting efficient communications markets
    <ul>
    <li>High quality, strategic and timely advice on necessary market settings to promote competition, while ensuring access to basic services, making available socially valuable content, and safeguarding consumers from inappropriate content and unfair dealing.</li>
    <li>Effective regulatory frameworks for, and information about open, competitive and efficient communications markets, consumer interests, and online safety and security.</li>
    <li>Contribution to the broad objective that all Australians have access to a range of free-to-air and subscription television and radio services, through effective policy and effectively administered funding.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Media policy</h3>
    <p>In 2014&ndash;15, we provided advice to the Minister on a wide range of broadcasting issues, including:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>developments in commercial, community and national radio and television sectors, and subscription television</li>
    <li>compliance with relevant codes</li>
    <li>ownership and control changes and anti-siphoning rules</li>
    <li>introduction of new digital broadcasting technologies</li>
    <li>general operation of broadcasting regulatory frameworks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Consistent with the Government&rsquo;s deregulation agenda, in 2014&ndash;15 we provided the Minister with advice on options to reduce the regulatory burden on the broadcasting industry. This resulted in deregulatory measures being included in the <em>Broadcasting and Other Legislation Amendment (Deregulation) Act 2015</em> to:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Remove or amend provisions related to digital switchover and the Restack Programme.</li>
    <li>Streamline the <?php infoTip('ACMA', 'Australian Communications and Media Authority') ?> 
&rsquo;s broadcasting spectrum-planning powers.</li>
    <li>Streamline broadcasters&rsquo; control and ownership reporting obligations.</li>
    <li>Reduce administrative costs and enhance flexibility for free-to-air and subscription television broadcasters in meeting their captioning obligations.</li>
    <li>Remove the need for subscription broadcasters to have their new eligible drama expenditure reports independently audited.</li>
    <li>Remove redundant and unnecessary legislation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We published a paper on the future regulation of digital television that examined the current television regulatory framework in the context of a rapidly changing communications environment and the Government&rsquo;s commitment to deregulation. The paper focused specifically on matters such as the availability and flexibility of television broadcasting services, the technical evolution of broadcasting and the use of broadcasting spectrum.</p>
    <p>We provided a report to the Minister on digital radio issues, including trends in the use of digital radio and alternative technologies. The report also considered the arrangements required to facilitate the rollout of digital radio in regional areas. The report was tabled in Parliament in July&nbsp;2015.</p>
    <p>In consultation with the ABC and SBS, we provided advice to the Minister on the implementation of the findings of the ABC and SBS Efficiency Study. Based on the Study&rsquo;s findings, we consulted with the broadcasters on options to, among other things, modernise their business models, outsource administrative functions, divest surplus assets as well as achieve greater cooperation between the ABC and SBS. The study has assisted the broadcasters identify efficiencies to their &lsquo;back of house&rsquo; functions without impacting on their programmes or other content. Building on this work the Government reduced funding to the national broadcasters by $308 million over five years from 2014&ndash;15.</p>
    <p>We provided assistance to the independent Nomination Panel for ABC and SBS Board appointments with the selection process completed in 2014 for the SBS Chairperson, one Non&ndash;executive Director for the SBS Board, and one Non-executive Director for the ABC Board. The Governor-General subsequently appointed Mr Nihal Gupta as SBS Chairperson, Mr Peeyush Gupta to the SBS Board and Mr Peter Lewis to the ABC Board on the recommendations of the Government. We also helped the Panel start a selection process in May 2015 for two Non-executive Directors for the ABC Board.</p>
    <p>We conducted an investigation on the context and decisions regarding the appearance of Mr Zaky Mallah on the ABCâ€™s Q&amp;A programme on 22 June 2015. The investigation report was provided to the Minister on 1 July 2015 and a summary of that report was published on 3 July 2015.</p>
    <p>In September 2014, the Minister announced that community television broadcasters in the five mainland state capitals would need to transition to online-only delivery. To facilitate this transition, access to broadcast spectrum for those community television broadcasters was extended to 31&nbsp;December 2015. We have provided assistance to the Minister and the community television industry to help with the transition. This included amending the Community Broadcasting Programme funding to provide $450,000 in transition funding for the affected community television broadcasters.</p>

    <p>KPI achieved:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Office of the Children&rsquo;s e-Safety Commissioner is established to promote a coordinated approach to <strong>online safety of children</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>On 24 March 2015, the <em>Enhancing Online Safety for Children Act 2015</em> came into effect. It established the Children&rsquo;s e-Safety Commissioner as an independent statutory office to take a national leadership role in online safety for children from 1 July 2015.</p>
    <p>The legislation was developed following substantial public and stakeholder consultation. This included considering more than 80 submissions received in response to the public discussion paper &lsquo;Enhancing Online Safety for Children&rsquo; released in January 2014.</p>
    <p>We provided advice to the Government, prepared and consulted on the regulation impact statement, developed the legislation and recruited the Commissioner. We also managed the transfer of online safety initiatives from our Department to the ACMA before the Commissioner started. Mr Alastair MacGibbon was appointed as Commissioner on 1 July 2015.</p>
    <h3>Powers and functions of the Commissioner</h3>
    <p>An important function of the Children&rsquo;s e-Safety Commissioner is to administer a complaints system to get cyberbullying material taken down quickly from social media sites. The Commissioner has the power to deal with a cyberbullying complaint in two ways:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>First, issue notices to large social media services to remove cyberbullying material targeted at an Australian child from the service.</li>
    <li>Second, give a notice to a person who posts cyberbullying material targeted at an Australian child to remove material, refrain from posting further material and apologise.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other functions of the Commissioner include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>promoting online safety for children</li>
    <li>coordinating relevant activities of Commonwealth departments, authorities and agencies</li>
    <li>supporting, conducting, accrediting and evaluating educational and community awareness programmes</li>
    <li>making grants</li>
    <li>advising the Minister.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Commissioner is supported by ACMA staff and resources.</p>
    <?php heading(4) ?>
    <p>KPI achieved:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Effective regulatory frameworks for, and information about open, competitive and efficient communications markets, consumer interests, and online safety and security.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Stay Smart Online programme is a whole-of-government initiative offering information and tips about online safety and security issues. The free Stay Smart Online Alert Service sends email and social media messages to more than 21,000 subscribers and 9,300 Facebook followers about current threats so they can take appropriate action to protect themselves. All information is independently verified, adding to the credibility of the service.</p>
    <p>Many of the subscribers and followers are programme partners who pass on messages to their own subscribers, followers, employees and customers.</p>
    <p>This year the website received 766,167 unique visitors.</p>
    <h3>Do Not Call Register</h3>
    <p>As a result of public consultation in December 2013, the Government agreed to amend the registration period on the Do Not Call Register from eight years to an indefinite period. The change was included in the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Deregulation) Bill 2014 that received Royal Assent on 13 April 2015. In February 2015, registrations of landline, mobile and fax numbers passed the 10 million milestone.</p>
    <?php heading(5) ?>
    <p>KPI achieved:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>High-quality, strategic and timely advice on necessary market settings to promote competition, while ensuring access to basic services, making available socially valuable content, and safeguarding consumers from inappropriate content.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Response to the Harper Review of competition policy</h3>
    <p>We provided advice to the Minister on possible implications for the communications sector, of recommendations in the Harper Review. The Review reported on 31 March 2015 and made a number of recommendations relating to competition, access and pricing and institutional arrangements that relate to communications markets and services. We continue to work with other agencies as part of the Government&rsquo;s response to the Review recommendations.</p>
    <h3>Improving our understanding of how communications markets work</h3>
    <p>We are enhancing our understanding of the efficient operation of Australian communications markets. The <?php infoTip('Bureau of Communications Research', 'The Department&rsquo;s independent economic and statistical research unit') ?> 
 developed an analytical framework for us to use to identify and assess factors that facilitate or impede the provision and use of digital services. By applying this framework to critical areas of the communications sector, we are enhancing our understanding of market dynamics and our capacity to promote a more efficient, innovative and competitive communications sector.</p>
    <h3>Consultation and stakeholder engagement</h3>
    <p>The Bureau of Communications Research established a Stakeholder Engagement Strategy to promote constructive working relationships with relevant stakeholders, apply engagement principles that best marry the Bureau&rsquo;s objectives with stakeholders&rsquo; expectations and facilitate targeted communications activities.</p>
    <p>In addition to the Strategy, we started engagement activities that further build on our strategic priorities, including:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>A forward release publication programme throughout 2015, which is updated on a regular and ongoing basis. Core publications include a package of key facts, leading sector-relevant indicators, and statistical snapshots, a study of the communications investment pipeline and analysis of relevant indicators of global competitiveness.</li>
    <li>International engagement through the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to improve our international presence and Australia&rsquo;s influence in international communications negotiations.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Triple Zero&mdash;review of the national operator</h4>
    <p>The Triple Zero (000) service is a highly trusted and reliable service for all Australians when they need to request emergency assistance. The current arrangements for the national Triple Zero operator were established when voice calls from landlines dominated the telecommunications landscape.</p>
    <p>In July 2014, the Government announced a review of the Triple Zero operator recognising that significant opportunities exist to take advantage of new technology and to respond to changing community expectations. Submissions to the review closed in August 2014 with approximately 50 formal submissions and over 3,000 responses to an online survey received. All non-confidential submissions have been published on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p>
    <p>Key issues raised by the submissions include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>strong support for accurate location positioning information for callers from mobiles</li>
    <li>improvements to multi-jurisdictional coordination arrangements as the service supports state and territory emergency response.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The review has concluded and a report was provided to the Government.</p>
    <h3>Australian Communications Consumer Action Network</h3>
    <p>The <em>Telecommunications Act 1997</em>&mdash;Section 593 grant provides for funding of consumer representation, and of research in relation to telecommunications. This funding is cost recovered via an annual <?php infoTip('Carrier', 'Holder of a carrier licence') ?> 
 Licence charge on eligible telecommunications carriers.</p>
    <p>The Australian Communications Consumer Action Network (<?php infoTip('ACCAN', 'Australian Communications Consumer Action Network') ?> ) is the current sole recipient of the Section 593 grant, which we administer through a multi-year funding Deed.</p>
    <p>We assessed ACCAN as having met the requirements of the Deed of Agreement after reviewing activities outlined in its quarterly progress reports and governance and operational documents:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>It represented the views and interests of telecommunications consumers from a range of sectors evidenced through submissions and positions on telecommunications consumer issues.</li>
    <li>It managed and provided funding for representation projects and carried out research into social, economic environmental technological implications of development relating to telecommunications.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ACCAN delivers information and education on telecommunication issues to consumers and organisations.</p>
