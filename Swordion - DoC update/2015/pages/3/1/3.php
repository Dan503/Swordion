    <p>In 2014&ndash;15, we took part in the following Australian National Audit Office cross-portfolio audits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Confidentiality in Government Contracts: Senate Order for Departmental <?php infoTip('Agency', 'Agencies are Departments of State, Departments of Parliament and &rsquo;prescribed agencies&rsquo; for the purposes of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. Where the term is used generally in this document, it is meant to refer to departments, agencies, authorities and non&mdash;commercial companies') ?> 
 Contracts. This started in 2013&ndash;14 and was tabled in 2014&ndash;15.</li>
        <li>Audits of the Financial Statements of Australian Government Entities for the Period Ended 30 June 2014.</li>
        <li>Interim phase of the Audits of the Financial Statements of Australian Government Entities for the Period Ended 30 June 2015.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>During 2014&ndash;15, the Commonwealth Ombudsman received 15 approaches about the Department, with one unfinalised approach carried forward from 2013&ndash;14. Of these approaches three were investigated and 13 were not. Of the 16 approaches, all had been finalised at the end of the reporting period.</p>
    <p>There were no judicial decisions, decisions of administrative tribunals or decisions by the Australian Information Commissioner that have had, or may have had, a significant impact on our operations during 2014&ndash;15.</p>
    <?php heading(1); ?>
    <p>Our Client Service Charter offers a contact point for clients to resolve complaints within the Department. Nine formal complaints were received during the reporting period. Often these complaints relate to issues outside the control of the Department, such as complaints regarding the actions of retail service providers. Our officers seek to work with impacted parties to resolve these complaints.</p>
    <?php heading(2); ?>
    <p>We experienced a 52 per cent decrease (31 requests) in the number of Freedom of Information (<?php infoTip('FOI', 'Freedom of Information') ?> 
) requests received this year. In part the decrease reflects the significant number of requests received in the previous reporting period that related to the Incoming Government Brief. In the current period requests have been less frequent and are more targeted resulting in fewer documents being captured for processing.</p>
    <p>Documents released through FOI are published in the FOI Disclosure Log.</p>
    <p>Agencies subject to the <em>Freedom of Information Act 1982</em> (FOI Act) are required to publish information to the public as part of the Information Publication Scheme (IPS). This requirement is in Part II of the FOI Act and has replaced the former requirement to publish a section 8 statement in an annual report. Each agency must display on its website a plan showing what information it publishes in accordance with the IPS requirements</p>

    <p>Throughout 2014&ndash;15, we supported the Minster and the Parliamentary Secretary and their offices by preparing, coordinating and processing responses to ministerial correspondence, questions taken on notice at Senate Estimates and Parliamentary Questions on Notice. We also prepared material for Senate Order reports, ministerial submissions and briefings on visits, meetings, functions, speeches, Question Time and Senate Estimates.</p>
