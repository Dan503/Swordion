    <p>Our <a href="http://www.communications.gov.au/about_us#corpplan"><?php infoTip('Corporate Plan 2014&ndash;17', 'The 2014&ndash;17 Corporate Plan has been updated to comply with Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act requirements and environmental developments since 2013. From 15 September 2015, our Corporate Plan is renamed as 2015&ndash;19 Corporate Plan') ?> </a> was developed in the first half of 2013&ndash;14 and launched on 28 February 2014. It sets out the strategic priorities driving our direction, organisational structure and work over the next four years:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Expanding digital infrastructure. Australia&rsquo;s economy and security increasingly relies on the availability and integrity of digital infrastructure, communications networks and systems. We advise Government on the necessary market settings to deliver competitive and efficient digital infrastructure to drive growth in the broader economy.</li>
    <li>Promoting efficient communications markets. For Australians to fully benefit from communications, broadcasting, media and other services the markets that supply these services must be trusted and operate efficiently. We advise Government on the necessary market settings to promote competition, while ensuring access to basic services, making available socially valuable content, and safeguarding consumers from inappropriate content.</li>
    <li>Strengthening our capabilities. To be the Government&rsquo;s pre-eminent advisor on digital technologies and communications services we must possess strong capabilities in leadership, strategy and delivery.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Following the new departmental structure taking effect on 1 September 2014, we have been reviewing and improving our existing internal business planning, risk management and resource allocation frameworks to align with our new structure, and facilitate and support strategic priorities in our Corporate Plan.</p>
    <?php heading(2); ?>
    <p>We are committed to promoting a culture that encourages rigorous risk assessment, informed risk taking and that anticipates risk in achieving objectives.</p>
    <p>The ELT is active in identifying emerging risks and managing identified strategic risks with formal discussions held once a month. The Audit Committee continues to provide independent advice and assurance to the Secretary on our control frameworks.</p>
    <p>Our Fraud Control arrangements comply with the Commonwealth Fraud Control Policy<em>. </em>In 2014&ndash;15, we carried out a department-wide fraud risk assessment. It found we had no significant gaps in our existing fraud controls. There were no incidents of fraud reported in 2014&ndash;15.</p>
    <?php heading(3); ?>
    <p>We have a Business Continuity Plan that outlines policies, procedures and responsibilities to make sure key business activities continue in the event business is interrupted.</p>
    <p>During 2014&ndash;15, a review of the plan started to reflect our new organisational structure. The Plan will continue to be modified and streamlined in early 2015&ndash;16.</p>
    <?php heading(4); ?>
    <p>During 2014&ndash;15, internal audit services were provided by KPMG and overseen by the Audit Committee. Assignments for Quarter 1 along with a selection or proposed topics for 2014&ndash;15 were approved in July 2014. We reviewed the Plan again in December 2014 to make sure the audit topics continued to reflect our risk profile.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>At the end of the reporting period six audits were completed with one still underway. These were a blend of traditional performance audits, pre-emptive proactive assist audits and a short &lsquo;in-flight&rsquo; audit.</p>
    <p>Recommendations were tracked and reported to the Audit Committee and Secretary.</p>
    <?php heading(5); ?>
    <p>During 2014&ndash;15, we continued to promote the importance of ethical standards through the Accountable Authority Instructions and practical guides, which were reviewed following the implementation of the <em>Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act</em>.</p>
