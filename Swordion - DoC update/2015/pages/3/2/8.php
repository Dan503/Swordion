    <p>Healthy Living Month was run in April 2015 to encourage staff to get active and think about health and wellbeing through activities that promote a healthy body and mind. 70 per cent of staff took part in the activities. 112 staff members received skin checks and 197 got flu shots.</p>
    <p>We commissioned a Work Health Safety audit that was carried out by an external contractor. It reviewed our Work Health Safety Management System and current processes, policies, registers, manuals and forms that make up the system. The audit also reviewed our Work Health and Safety training, to make sure all staff are made aware of, and committed to, their obligations under the <em>Work Health and Safety Act 2011</em>.</p>
    <p>We did not have any notifiable incidents in 2014&ndash;15, and no Provisional Improvement Notices were issued.</p>
    
<h3>Changes to disability reporting in annual reports</h3>
<p>Since 1994, Commonwealth departments and agencies have reported on their performance as policy adviser, purchaser, employer, regulator and provider under the Commonwealth Disability Strategy.  In 2007&ndash;08, reporting on the employer role was transferred to the Australian Public Service Commissionâ€™s State of the Service Report and the APS Statistical Bulletin.  These reports are available at <a href="http://www.apsc.gov.au">www.apsc.gov.au</a>.  From 2010&ndash;11, departments and agencies have no longer been required to report on these functions.
</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Disability Strategy has been overtaken by the National Disability Strategy 2010&ndash;2020, which sets out a ten year national policy framework to improve the lives of people with disability, promote participation and create a more inclusive society. A high level two-yearly report will track progress against each of the six outcome areas of the Strategy and present a picture of how people with disability are faring. The first of these reports will be available in late 2014, and can be found at <a href="http://www.dss.gov.au">www.dss.gov.au</a>.
