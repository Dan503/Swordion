    <p>Parliament gives the Department two types of funding: departmental and administered. Departmental funds are used to produce goods and services (outputs) at a quantity, quality and price endorsed by the Government. We administer funds, assets and liabilities on behalf of the Australian Government, which controls how we use them and requires us to account for them separately.</p>
