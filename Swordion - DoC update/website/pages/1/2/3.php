    <p>The Secretary of the Department throughout 2014&ndash;15 was Drew Clarke.</p>
    <p>Several changes were made to our structure and functions in 2014&ndash;15 and included:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>From February to August 2014, we carried out a department-wide layer-by-layer design and selection process to redesign jobs and place staff into a new structure. The new structure started on 1 September 2014 and represents a significant step forward in aligning our people and our resources to our strategic priorities in a smaller organisation.</li>
        <li>The Bureau of Communications and Research was created in September 2014 following the appointment of Dr Paul Paterson as Chief Economist. The Bureau was created as a professionally independent unit within the Department to contribute to strengthening and maintaining our strategic policy and research capability. It provides authoritative economic research and market analysis of the communications sector to inform policy development and advice, improve the evidence base for our policy agenda, and contribute to informing public debate and community awareness of emerging trends in the communications sector.</li>
        <li>The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Deregulation) Bill 2014 was passed by the Parliament on 25 March 2015 and as part of the deregulation and smaller government agenda, the functions of the Telecommunications Universal Service Management <?php infoTip('Agency', 'Agencies are Departments of State, Departments of Parliament and &rsquo;prescribed agencies&rsquo; for the purposes of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. Where the term is used generally in this document, it is meant to refer to departments, agencies, authorities and non&mdash;commercial companies') ?> 
 (<?php infoTip('TUSMA', 'Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency') ?> 
) were transitioned into our Department on 1 July 2015.</li>
    </ul>
